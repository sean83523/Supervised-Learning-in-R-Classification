##2.Visualizing classification trees

-Examine the loan_model object
> loan_model
- Load the rpart.plot package
> library(rpart.plot)

-Plot the loan_model with default settings
> rpart.plot(loan_model)

-Plot the loan_model with customized settings
> rpart.plot(loan_model, type = 3, box.palette = c("red", "green"), fallen.leaves = TRUE)

##3. Creating random test datasets

-Determine the number of rows for training
nrow(loans)
-Create a random sample of row IDs
sample_rows <- sample(nrow(loans), nrow(loans)*0.75)
-Create the training dataset
loans_train <- loans[sample_rows,]
-Create the test dataset
loans_test <- loans[-sample_rows,]
